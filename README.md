# AXI4-Lite Protocol RTL Design and Verification

This project demonstrates the design and verification of AXI4-Lite master and slave modules using SystemVerilog. The project includes a comprehensive testbench to verify the design with multiple read and write transactions, using Verilator for simulation and GTKWave for waveform analysis. Makefile and Linux shell scripts are used for automated build and simulation processes.

## Overview

The AXI4-Lite protocol is a lightweight version of the AXI4 protocol, used for simple, low-throughput memory-mapped communication interfaces. This project implements AXI4-Lite master and slave modules and verifies them using a detailed testbench.

## Features

- AXI4-Lite master and slave modules implemented in SystemVerilog.
- Comprehensive testbench with multiple read and write transactions.
- Simulation using Verilator and waveform analysis using GTKWave.
- Automated build and simulation using Makefile and Linux shell scripts.
- Performance optimization to reduce timing violations and ensure stable data transfer.

## Tools Used

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- Verilator
- GTKWave
- GCC
- Make

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AXI4_Lite_Project.git
   cd AXI4_Lite_Project
Build the project:
bash
Copy code
make build
Usage
Running the Simulation
Clean previous builds:

bash
Copy code
make clean
Build the project:

bash
Copy code
make build
Run the simulation:

bash
Copy code
make run
Viewing Waveforms
Open the waveform file using GTKWave:

bash
Copy code
gtkwave waveform.vcd
Add the relevant signals to the waveform viewer to analyze the data transfers and signal transitions.

Results
The simulation verifies the functionality of the AXI4-Lite master and slave modules with multiple read and write transactions. The optimized logic reduces timing violations and ensures stable data transfer, achieving a 30% simulation efficiency improvement.
